# POE

## What is it?

POE means Proof of Execution. It is our way of keeping track with the events that we organize or take part of their organization. What this means is that for each and every event we create a word document with details about the event and usually we attach a picture too. 

## How to write a POE

*IMPORTANT!*
Use the template from this repository!

### Step 1: Modify the name of the file using the following convention: (DATE)(POE)NAME.docx

 * `DATE`: MM.DD.YYYY  (*Attention!* this is the date AT WHICH the event happened, not when you write the POE)
 * `POE`: just leave it like that
 * `NAME`: the name of the event

### Step 2: Start writing!

Using the template below

Modify the Date, Title and Body as you consider. 
*Important!* Check the event's card on *Trello* for pictures at the event and try to include one in the POE!

### Step 3: Save the document

Save the document *both* as *Docx* and *PDF*!

### Step 4: Finishing Up

Upload both the *Docx* and *PDF* to *Trello* (on the corresponding card) and :white_check_mark: your name on the POE section.
