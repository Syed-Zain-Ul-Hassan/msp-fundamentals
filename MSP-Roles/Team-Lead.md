# Team Leader

* The Team-Lead must also respect the MSP requirements (TODO: link to that)

## Requirements

* Coordinate all the Boards (and sometimes the Members)
* Come up with an overview for the yearly events
* Communicate with the Country-Lead and forward information to the team
* Be involved in the Activities of MSPs, review them
* Review overall activity, solve general problems with the Organization
* Communicate with the University
* Organize general feedback sessions between members once/semester
* Handle feedback from Board Members and Members
* Split information accross Members, the Team-Lead should not be the only person to know organizational matters
